# Codex

Using the Codex will allow you to cross check your inventory with all cards in Tykhe, allowing you to more easily determine what cards you own or are missing; out of a specific category, all subcategories to a category, or all cards in a subcategory.

`!codex` will list the available categories.  
`!codex [cat]` will list all sub-categories in the [cat], as well as your count of how many of the cards you own.  
`!codex [cat],[subcat]` will list all cards in the specific [cat]+[subcat], as well as your count of how many of the cards you own, and your highest rarity of the specific cards.

Additionally:  
`!codex [cat],[subcat], (collected | uncollected)` will list either your specific **collected** or **uncollected** cards in the [cat]+[subcat], depending on which you use.

Master Syntax:  
`!codex [category], (subcategory), (collected | uncollected)`
