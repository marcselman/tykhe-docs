## Global Identification Number - GID

GID's are the identification number for cards, prior to ownership. They can be used in junction with `!search [type],[cat],[GID]` to view cards without rolling them first.

See [Search](search) for more specific information on how to use GID's.

## User Identification Number - UID.

UID's are the identification number for cards that belong to a specific user. They can be used to view the card from a users inventory.

Additionally:

`!gift` will attempt to retain UID's when possible. If a user already has the duplicate UID being gifted, a new one will be generated.

`!merge` will always retain the first UID inputted.

If you are intending to retain a UID you like, it is up to you to be aware of these factors.

See [Inventory](basics/inventory) for more specific information on how to use UID's.
