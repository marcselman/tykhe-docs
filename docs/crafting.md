For visual guide, check the gif below.

## Crafting Commands:

`!craft` will list the available crafting types.
`!craft [cat]` will list the available categories in the crafting category.

## Crafting Artifacts:

Artifacts are rare cards that can only be crafted and not rolled. To craft them, you must first roll the required materials, which can only be acquired as a rare drop from `!roll` commands.

Once you have rolled a material you can use `!materials` to see what you own.

After using `!craft [cat]` - Inside each artifact embed you will see a recipe, with each component having either an ❌ or ✅ - These represent what you own, and your progress towards all of the components in the artifact recipe. When you have every component, press the ⚒️ to consume your materials and assemble the artifact.

Once you have crafted the artifact, it will then be in your inventory.

- Artifacts act as normal cards.
- Artifacts start at star level 1 <span class="star1"></span>
- They can be equipped on profile, they are assigned a UID, and you can merge duplicates to increase their star level.
