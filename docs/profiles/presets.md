# Profile Presets

Profile presets are preset save slots used to store profile setups.
All users start with 3, and you can buy 3 more (up to 6) via credits in the shop.

`!shop upgrades`

The first upgrade costs 500, the next 1000 and the last 1500 credits.

How to manage your profile save slots: **(Commands only usable in Tykhe DM.)**  
`!profile [save | load | delete], [name]`

- `[save],[name]` will save your current profile to an available preset, with your inputted name.
If your inputted [name] already exists, it will save your current profile to that preset.

- `[load],[name]` will load the saved preset.
- `[delete],[name]` will delete the saved preset.
- `[rename],[name]` will rename the existing preset name.

- `!profile presets` will list your current presets and their name in this format:
