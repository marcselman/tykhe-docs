# Star Levels and Merging

For visual guide, check the gif below.

## Star Levels
Every card you roll has a % odd to be Stars 1 through 4. You will see this displayed via colored stars on the embed, and the embeds color.  
Only star levels 1 through 4 can be rolled. To achieve star level 5+, you must merge two of the same together.

## Merging

### React Merge Chain:

If you roll a card that you already have in your inventory, including the same star level, after claiming you will be prompted to auto-merge via a react:

<div class="img_16">

![2 to 3](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/832169226658644008.webp?size=96&quality=lossless)
![3 to 4](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/832169241113133097.webp?size=96&quality=lossless)
![4 to 5](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/832169255994261524.webp?size=96&quality=lossless)

</div>

When you press this react, it will automatically merge the two cards in your inventory together.  
If you then have two of the higher level, it will create a chain merge react, and continue until the merging is no longer possible.

### Manual Merging:

If you have two identical cards, including their star level, you can merge them manually by using:
`!merge [cat],[UID],[UID]`

Manual merging can also initiate a React Merge Chain, which will function identically.  
Automatic React Merge Chains will ignore cards tagged with :lock: from affiliating, when possible.
